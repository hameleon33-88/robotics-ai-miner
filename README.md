# Robotics AI Miner – Testnet Model

This repository contains a minimal Robotics AI agent submitted for
review to join the Konnex AI Miner testnet network.

## Overview
The model simulates a robotics decision-making agent that processes
sensor input (obstacles, battery level) and outputs navigation actions.

## Architecture
- Lightweight rule-based AI logic
- Designed for robotics and autonomous agent simulation
- Suitable for testnet AI mining environments

## Purpose
This model is provided for onboarding and review as part of the
Konnex testnet AI Miner program.
